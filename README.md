# Augmented Reality Mirror (Record)

The [Augmented Reality Mirror](https://github.com/alexwang0311/Augmented-Reality-Mirror) is an AR game that lets you see how your muscles and bones move in real time. <br>
This is a scientific outreach project that I completed during my time at the [Vanderbilt MASI](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/masi/) lab for the 2019 Vanderbilt Undergraduate Summer Research Program. <br>
This is a special version created to be used in the demo for the Sports Science class at Metro Nashville Public Schools.


## Description
Please refer to the [Augmented Reality Mirror](https://github.com/alexwang0311/Augmented-Reality-Mirror) project.

## Notes
This version of the **Augmented Reality Mirror** has an experimental feature that allows you to record the motion of a selected joint and generates a graph of its displacement and velocity.
